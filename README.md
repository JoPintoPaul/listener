# listener

Welcome to the listener service.

To use the service, use the following URL for callback in your service: `http://localhost:12345/listen`

Make sure that your service is running on the correct URL by starting it with the following command: `sbt "run 12345"`

You will see a log of all incoming callbacks in the application log.
